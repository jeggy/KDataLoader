== Kotlin Multiplatform project

KDataLoader supports multiplatform projects.
Currently only `jvm` and `js` is supported.

In order to use KDataLoader in a multiplatform project you just need to include one dependency in the commons-section.
There is no need to import the platform libraries separately.

[source,groovy]
----
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation 'de.nidomiro:KDataLoader:0.3.0'
            }
        }
    }
}
----

== JVM-Project

For a JVM-only project you just need to include the following dependency:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    implementation 'de.nidomiro:KDataLoader-jvm:0.3.0'
}
